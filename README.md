Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.

Current functionalities include:

1) A sound and animation that corresponds to each button plays both when the series of button presses plays, and when the player personally presses a button.
2) check for correct soultion after each button press, so that the game ends as soon as player presses a wrong button
